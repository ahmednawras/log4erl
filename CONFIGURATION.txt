Introduction:
=============
This document explains the format of log4erl configuarion file. The configuration file is simple
and easy to write. At any place in the file, any thing you type after '%' is a comment.
You can find a sample configuration in the file 'log4erl.conf' under 'priv' directory.

* Loggers:
==========
 It contains a list of logs with the format below, where
<name> is any name you'd like to call it. <name> can later on be used with any of the log messages
in log4erl API (e.g. log4erl:info/2,3,4). If no value for <name> exists or value of "default" suplied,
then the elements inside '{' and '}' will be applied to the default logger.

logger [<name>] {
       ...
}

Example:
--------
logger application_logger{
       ...
}

%% default logger
logger {
       ...
}

* Appenders:
============
Inside each logger, there can be 1 or more appenders. These appenders can be 
added inside loggers according to the format below.

<appender_type> <name> {
	...
}

Example:
--------
file_appender file1{
	...
}

insider appenders' block, you can add properties for that appender in the format 'property=value'.
